Making it easier for you to connect the dots and find the root cause of issues, New Relicâ€™s AIOps solution, Applied Intelligence, now includes any relevant APM deployment data related to issues. Changes, such as deployments, account for a high percentage of the root causes of incidents and having that information at hand can be crucial to the speedy diagnosis and resolution of issues impacting your environment.

Information about related deployments from [APM deployment events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/events/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users) are now surfaced and linked to issues in the issue feed within Incident Intelligence. This information about recent deployments, their impact on Apdex scores, response times, throughput, and errors, can be surfaced by clicking on **show all deployments** in the issue page.
