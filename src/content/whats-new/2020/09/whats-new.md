Over the last month or two, we’ve made a lot of [changes](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/reimagined-new-relic-one-experience/). As we continue to build out new features and make iterations to New Relic One based on your feedback, we want to ensure you have an easy way to find all the information that you care about and need to navigate the platform.

That is why we’ve created What’s New: your one-stop-shop to quickly learn more about every new change and feature. When there are updates to New Relic One, you will be notified and directed to What’s New for a closer look at what we’ve released. There, you will find posts for each feature with a brief description (of its utility), resources, tip-and-tricks, and best practices to ensure you are productively leveraging the newest innovations and getting the most out of New Relic One.

The best part about having this wealth of information and tools at your fingertips is that you won’t ever have to leave New Relic One.

So what’s new this time around? Check it out for yourself: in New Relic One, just head to the **account dropdown**, then click **What’s new?**
