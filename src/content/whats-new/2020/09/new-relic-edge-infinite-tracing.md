New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, cloud-native tail-based distributed tracing service. This new service observes 100% of all application traces across your distributed systems, and provides visualization and storage for the most actionable data so you can investigate and solve issues faster. Since there’s no infrastructure to manage, you won’t need to staff or plan for operating the service and can expect unparalleled, on-demand scalability.
